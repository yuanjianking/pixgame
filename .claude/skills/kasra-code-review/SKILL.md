# Kasra Code Review

When a user types `/kasra-code-review [path]`, use the Kasra MCP tools to perform a security review of the code repository.

## Execution Method (MCP only)

Call the `kasra_scan_file` MCP tool with the user-specified path (defaults to `.`):

- Tool: `kasra_scan_file`
- Parameter `path`: the directory or file to scan
- Returns: JSON with `scan_path`, `files_scanned`, `total_findings`, `findings`

Parse the returned findings and format as the report below. If the MCP server is unreachable, report an error and suggest checking the MCP server status.

## Output Format

```
🔒 Kasra Security Review Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📁 Scan path: <path>
📄 Files scanned: <N>
🔍 Findings: <N> (P0: <N>, P1: <N>, P2: <N>)

🔴 P0 - [SEC-05] SQL Injection Risk
   File: src/api/routes.py:42
   Risk: Using string concatenation to build SQL queries, vulnerable to injection
   Fix: Use parameterized queries
   ───
   ❌ Unsafe: cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
   ✅ Safe: cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))

🟡 P1 - [SEC-12] XSS Risk
   ...

🟢 P2 - [IAC-01] Dockerfile image tag not pinned
   ...

📊 Overall Assessment: ⚠️ High-risk issues found, fix before committing
```

## Analysis Rules

When reporting findings, always include for each item:
1. **Risk description** — why this is a security issue
2. **Location** — file:line
3. **Fix recommendation** — with before/after code examples
4. **Severity** — color-coded (🔴 P0 / 🟡 P1 / 🟢 P2)

Severity priority:
- **P0** → Blocked. Must fix before merging.
- **P1** → Warning. Should fix, high risk.
- **P2** → Advisory. Best practice improvement.
